<font size="2" style="line-height: 1.35em" face="arial,helvetica">[Extract from fic 
called 'Buffybot Behind Bars!' &nbsp;Willow is discussing sending Buffybot a 
mobile phone message by Kes]<br>
<br>
"The problem is her other systems tend to interfere with the signal, so I 
couldn't make it reliable enough. &nbsp;But if we sent her a boosted signal we 
might just get through. &nbsp;We can only pray it doesn't jam up any of her other 
programs - the first time I tried it she started walking around in circles 
and bouncing off the furniture, singing "You're not the boss of me now, 
you're not the boss of me now, you're not the boss of me now, and you're not 
so big - endlessly, for hours." &nbsp;Willow's face took on a brooding look as 
she remembered the pain of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Why<i> They Might Be Giants</i>?" said Xander curiously, "I'd expect her to 
like <i>East 17</i> or some other boyband thing." <br>
<br>
"Warren," said Willow darkly. &nbsp;"I've been trying my witchy utmost to root 
all the jerk related stuff out of her program, but she still knows all the 
words to Triangle Man and she still thinks baseball caps worn backwards are 
cool - he seems to have programmed that one in right at the beginning. &nbsp;Of 
course, she also loves <i>Steps</i> - but that's all her own lousy taste. 
&nbsp;I've been playing her some cool stuff, but the only one she's really taken 
to is Tori Amos going on about cheese and onion sandwiches - I guess that 
struck a chord with her."<br>
