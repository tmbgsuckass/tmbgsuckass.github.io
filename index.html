<center>The TMBG Sucks Ass Club has been taken over by some people on Discord. The original version of the site is still on <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/band2/tmbgsuckass/index.html">Angelfire</a>, however as far as we know Dawn does not maintain the site anymore. Dawn, if you see this and you're unhappy with the new site, please contact me via Discord.

<p><b>Why do we hate them?  Let me count the ways and reasons.</b></p>
</font>
<font size="3" color="#993333">
<p>"We hate Warren and everyone knows they are his favorite band. Their CD was in his van. Probably. Fairly certain. It should have been."<br>
---Dawn</p>
<p>"I hate They Might Be Giants...they wrote a fucking song called Triangle Man... Lyrically they make no sense. None."<br>
                            ---Beamer</p>
<p>"As for TMBG I've heard exactly 1 song from them, so I can't really form an opinion, but in interviews they always seemed so "Hipper Than Thou", so I can still get down with hating them."<br>
                            ---Unicornkid</p>
<p>"I've never actually listened to TMBG, but my brother's ex-wife loved them and she was a total wack job so I'm gonna ahead and join the club."<br>
                           ---Kittyb90</p>
<p>"Hell, I have no idea who TMBG or whatever are, but that's probably because they suck bigtime, so I'm in."<br>
---Hoene</p>
<p>"When I was in I think my sophomore year my boyfriend then was in love with TMBG. He use to sit around all day and just hum or sing their songs. He found out the when Missa was younger she liked the Birdhouse in Your Soul song, so any time he would be around her he would sing her that song. Then he found out she hated the Triangle Man (I always thought it was called Particle man?) song, so he would sing that to her. One day he went too far and she kicked him in the nuts, I then broke up with him. The point of this all being that when I look back, he was almost the same as Warren, looks and attitude. So yes Warren would like TMBG."<br>
                          ---Bethany</p>
<p>"I don't really have anything against TMBG one way or another. I just heard there would be plenty of oral sex opportunities for interns and hating TMBG seems a small price to pay."<br>
                          ---Eunice</p>
<p>"One time, I went up to John Linnell to ask him for his autograph. He just looked at me blankly for a few seconds. Then his face turned three shades of red. Suddenly, he pulled out a switchblade and began carving his name on my forhead!! Two of his ever-present bodyguards held me so that I couldn't defend myself. He screamed,"You want my autograph, you little punk!!?? Wear it for life!!!" Then a bunch of his sycophant fans started cheering as the blood ran relentlessly down my face. John gave me a final kick in the crotch as he turned to walk away. And that's why I hate They Might Be Giants."<br>---J.D.</p>

<b><font size="3" color="#000000">Actually I went and read fan sites in order to steal this picture.  They really are nice guys who are very into computers.  They have been best friends for years and they <i>try</i> to write deep and meaningful lyrics.  I guess I am saying they are not so bad, but we do not like their music.  Damn them for being nice.  We are not suppose to like you and I will not start now.  I forgot about the day when you guys were on Tech TV.  That was cool.  But if it had been really cool, I wouldn't have forgotten and started this club.</font></b>

<p>**Jake pointed out they did the theme from the Jon Stewart Show, which I also kinda like.  So OK.  Fine. They can do TV themes.  Doesn't make them bloody brilliant.</p>
